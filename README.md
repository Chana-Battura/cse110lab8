Question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 
Answer: Graceful degradation relates to the idea that applications being able to perform even with limited resources and capabilities.  Service workers directly addresses this because it allows an application to not be heavily reliant on the network and allows for the application to perform even with this restriction of offline access.
